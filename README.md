# Movie_Recommendation_system
Hey Everyone , This is an Movie Recommendation system project , 
made using the python libraries(stremlit , pandas, nltk ,sklearn)

I have used the TMBD data set 
1> tmbd_5000_movies.csv
2> tmbd_5000_credit.csv
(data set from kaggle website)


for the recommendation feature , have made a similarity vector (1-0)  for all the movies 
and on the basis of this the movies are recommended for the selected movie.

I have also used the TMBD Api for the fetch of poster of movies based on their movie_id .
reffer the TMBD.api for the futher reffernce .

Hosted the project using the streamlit share
